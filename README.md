# Weather-App

The Weather-App project requests data from the OpenWeatherMap's API and displays the response data in a visaully pleasing way. The website is called the Weather App. However, the website doesnt work on phones like an app implies. I did not add responsivness because I wanted to replicated a design that wasnt intended to be resized.

## Motivation

I became motivated to create this websites from viewing the design of The [Weather Networks - 7 Days Forcast column](https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/weather/alberta/calgary).
I decided I wanted to try to make a similar looking design with whatever data the OpenWeatherMap API provided.
